# MicroBlocks-SCD30
Library and example code to run the [environmental sensor SCD30](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors-scd30/) from within [MicroBlocks](https://microblocks.fun). 

*Now high school students can build quality CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring solutions to reduce Covid risk within the interactive and visual programming environment MicroBlocks (think Scratch for IoT) for many different embedded devices.* 

## SCD30
The SCD30 is an environmental sensor to measure CO<sub>2</sub> in ppm, temperature in Â°C, and humidity in %.

It is a [nondispersive infrared sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondispersive_infrared_sensor), short an "NDIR sensor".
NDIR seonsors are spectography type sensors targeted towards gas molecules, in this case towards CO<sub>2</sub>. They deliver more accurate results than cheaper [MOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_sensor) sensors like the [SGP30](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/sgp30/) targeting CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent gases like H<sub>2</sub>: SCD30 has an accuracy of 3% whereas SGP30 only achieves 15%. NDIR sensors are also independent of chemical reactions unlike MOS based sensors and hence do not have to be recalibrated in the long run. They are a bit more expensive though.

## Context
The corona epidemic is hitting students hard: They risk isolation at home and infection in the class rooms. One puzzle piece to mitigate the risk is to install CO<sub>2</sub> monitors in the class rooms. There are good commercial solutions available -- and hopefully installed by now in many schools. Still, this problem domain should be a good motivation for both teachers and students to delve into MINT and build their own CO<sub>2</sub> appliances using affordable IoT devices like micro:bit, Calliope mini, or the AdaFruit Circuit Playground Express. They might even use it and avoid some infections by getting reminded to open the windows when needed.

But what is the advantage of this solution compared to using native drivers already available for the mentioned platforms? 
- Vittascience is comparable to MicroBlocks as it also targets different platforms, has graphical user interface and an underlying language (
Vittascience has a rudementary driver for reading out the values [here](https://github.com/vittascience/microbit-libraries/blob/master/scd30.py).
