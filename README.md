# MicroBlocks-SCD30
Library and example code to run the [environmental sensor SCD30](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors-scd30/) from within [MicroBlocks](https://microblocks.fun). 

Now you can build high quality CO<sub>2</sub> monitors to reduce Covid risk with the same visual programming environment for many different embedded devices. 


## SCD30
The SCD30 is an environmental sensor to measure CO<sub>2</sub> in ppm, temperature in Â°C, and humidity in %.

It is a [nondispersive infrared sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondispersive_infrared_sensor), short an "NDIR sensor".
NDIR seonsors are spectography type sensors targeted towards gas molecules, in this case towards CO<sub>2</sub>. They deliver more accurate results than cheaper [MOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_sensor) sensors like the [SGP30](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/sgp30/) targeting CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent gases like H<sub>2</sub>: SCD30 has an accuracy of 3% whereas SGP30 only achieves 15%. NDIR sensors are also independent of chemical reactions unlike MOS based sensors and hence do not have to be recalibrated in the long run. They are a bit more expensive though.
